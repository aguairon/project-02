### Website overview
Movies website is a simple website that allows users to search for their favourite movies, view their details and find cinemas near them.

In the homepage there is a selection of movies with the word Star in their title. But if the user wants to find other movies they have a search bar that searches the API every few seconds, once something has been typed in it, to populate the homepage with the results.

Once the user finds a movie they are interested in they can view the movie details on the movie show page. In this page they will have not only the metascore for the film, actors and plot for the selected movie bust also the runtime, language and genre.
